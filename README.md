AngularFakeE-commerce
This repository contains the project I submitted during the second exam session at the full stack developer training school I am attending (Labfortraining). It was developed using Angular 16, drawing upon the knowledge acquired during the training course as well as independently gained knowledge during the one-month period allotted to complete the assignment.

The assigned task was to simulate an E-commerce website for shoes, aiming for fidelity to existing online platforms. All key functionalities (such as cart management, checkout, login and registration, as well as search capabilities by name, category, best sellers, and new arrivals) are active. Additionally, I implemented a multifilter concept similar to those found on real E-commerce websites.

I received a final grade of 30/30 for this assignment, the highest possible score.


Note:

- I have used placeholder images as they are CC0 (free-to-use license). In the actual project, appropriate images related to the category/shoe/other should be used.

- Remember to download the package.json as I have utilized some ngx libraries (ngx slider, for instance).

- The SVGs are also placeholders.
